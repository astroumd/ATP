The Astronomical Journal (AJ). Published by the American Astronomical
Society, this journal publishes original astronomical research, with
an emphasis on significant scientific results derived from
observations. Publications in AJ include descriptions of data capture,
surveys, analysis techniques, astronomical interpretation,
instrumentation, and software and computing.


The Astrophysical Journal (ApJ). Published by the American
Astronomical Society, this journal is devoted to recent developments,
discoveries, and theories in astronomy and astrophysics. ApJ
publications constitute significant new research that is directly
relevant to astrophysical applications, whether based on observational
results or on theoretical insights or modeling. ApJ publishes articles
that make use of extensive observational data if the data are subject
to astrophysical interpretations.


The Astrophysical Journal Letters (ApJL). Published by the American
Astronomical Society, this journal is the premier journal for rapid
publication of high-impact astronomical research. ApJL publishes brief
reports on the most influential developments across astronomy and
astrophysics. The journal specializes in articles that are timely,
containing new discoveries and results that have a significant
immediate impact on other researchers. Articles published in ApJL are
self-contained, including context that is generally understandable by
scientists who are not specialists in the particular field.


Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society (MNRAS). Among the
longest established and world's leading primary research journals in
astronomical and astrophysics, this journal publishes the results of
original research in positional and dynamical astronomy, astrophysics,
radio astronomy, cosmology, space research, and the design of
astronomical instruments.


New Astronomy (NA). Published by Elsevier, this journal publishes
articles in all fields of astronomy and astrophysics, with a
particular focus on computational astronomy: mathematical and
astronomy techniques and methodology, simulations, modeling and
numerical results and computational techniques in instrumentation. It
is a relatively new addition to the peer-review astronomical journals,
and was established in 1996.
