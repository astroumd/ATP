ATP promotion materials, templates, examples, ADS workflows

There are two templates in here.  A .docx and .tex file. They may
seem to conflict a bit in their directions, but to quote an email
reply querying about this:

*I believe the goal of this template is to let you know what kinds of
information are desirable without being proscriptive about how to
include them.* *If you don't have any entries in a particular section,
you can delete that section from the template.*

*For the personal information section, you could just list information
in any way that seems clear to you, such as:*

	Rebecca Follman
	2117 Main Administration
	rfollman@umd.edu

	2016-present, Senior Web Developer, Office of the Provost, UMD
	etc.

*For the publications section, we recommend that you follow the practices
of your discipline, especially with regard to citation style and the
order of publications on the CV.*
